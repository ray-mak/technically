Included is a simple UI for user sign-in and sign-up. It also includes a simple UI for password reset and email verification.

## TODO

- Style the email verified and expired token pages.
- Implement rate limiting for password reset and email verification.

## NOTES

- If user signs in with GitHub but email is private, then the email they have on file will be their github username.
